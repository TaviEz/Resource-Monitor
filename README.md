# Resource Monitor
 
 The project is structured into classes which are frames in the tkinter ui.

Firstly, the getData.py is run using task scheduler hourly for 24h, and then the resource-monitor can display the average, minimum and maximum of CPU/RAM usage.
Besides these, the program displays in real-time the usage of the cpu/ram, and can also plot these values using graphs. It also displays the partitions and the availabile/total space and some general info about the user's processor
